### PROCESS
**SUCCESSFUL AND MEMORABLE ARCHITECTURE** is the product of vision, engagement, and collaboration between you and your architect working together to develop and implement your project ideas, no matter how abstract or specific they may be, into a creative and optimal design solution. Our design process is inclusionary and evolutionary. We evaluate design solutions on many levels – aesthetic, functional, environmental, and contextual aspects are measured – according to a client’s specific criteria and our professional standards. Whether it is a major project such as a new facility, or a smaller undertaking such as an addition or renovation, at GRESLA ARCHITECTS we passionately work to develop creative and individualized design solutions.

Let us begin a dialog on how our design expertise can serve to improve your facility and delivery of services. Please give us a call or send us [an email](info@greslaarchitects.com).

> A client’s satisfaction resulting from thoughtful and creative design solutions is our primary goal and greatest reward.
